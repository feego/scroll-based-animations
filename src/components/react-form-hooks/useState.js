/**
 * Builds the state hooks that `useController` will use to store all form related data.
 * NOTE: `useFormController` already creates it's own state hooks internally by default, if we don't give it
 * custom owns as options. However, for the specific case of the single add form, we need to isolate the form
 * state from the controller, so we can access it before we actually use the form controller hook.
 *
 * @param {Object} options - Options.
 * @returns {Object} State hooks to be used with `useFormController`.
